# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```

Link to "bad" visualization- https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/putra.gema.nusa7221/viz/complaint_customer/Dashboard1
  
The reason I classified the first visualization as "bad" is because of...

- unclear title descriptions: some titles such as "total company" or "total complaint" feel vague and like they could be formulated better to give more context
  
- inaccessible label styles: there's a lack of visual hierarchy for labels and titles that makes it hard to know how to consume the data and where to put your focus.In addition to that, the contrast between the colours used for visuals and the background colour/dark colour used for text isn't high enough and causes some context to be lost for what is being shown
  
- unclear meaning conveyed by some visuals: the 2 largest visuals on the dashboard - map and line graph- do not have any labels, legends or informative titles to help people understand what is being shown and how to interpret the data 
  
- colour choice + data topic: given the negative nature of the data that is being displayed- customer complaints- I think using a dark colour palette of reds and black amplifies the negativity of the topic and doesn't make me want to dive into the data further

- data source also not cited but there are big button linkouts to information that isn't related to the data being shown, again a problem of hierarchy but also relevance



    Link to "good" visualization -     https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/prasann.prem/viz/SalesAnalysisDashboard_16971728056280/SalesDashboard-Overview

The reason I classified the second visualization as "good" is because of...

- clear title descriptions: for each tabbed section the visuals are accompanied by clear and descriptive titles that tell you exactly what is being displayed and they also inlcued captions to help guide people on how to interact with the visuals in order to interpret the data better. The explanatory approach helps with reducing cognitive load
  
- colour palette + accessible label styles: the visual hierarchy for labels and titles is distinct and makes it clear which info is most important and where to focus your attention as you go through the dashboard. In addition to that, the contrast between the colours used for visuals and the text coloir is accessible and the overall colour palette gives an airy, professional vibe that makes me want want to dive into the data further
  
- tabbed approach to breaking down and grouping like content: due to the vastness of the data being looked at for this dashboard, the author grouped like data topics ( ex. Gestalt similarity principle) into 3 groups and then separated the visuals for these groups under tabs which I think helps reduce cognitive load  and makes the data more organized and easy to interpret
  
- data source not cited here as well but becuase of the overall better design of the dashboard I'd be more inclined to trust the data and not look for the source 






      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
   The "bad" visualization could be imporved by..
  
  - changing the colour palette of the dashboard so labels and text are accessible against the background/visual colours
  -  add labels, legends or informative titles to help people understand what is being shown on the map and line graph and how to interpret the data 
  - citing the data source for reproducibility, to increase trustworthiness in the data visualiztions and also to get more context of the data if something viewers want is missing from the visualizations 

  
   The "good" visualization could be imporved by..

  - Even though the titles and labels for this dashboard are more descriptive and informative I think there is too much written detail for some visual elements that seem redunant or aren't adding any extra value, so an improvement would be making written labels on visuals more conside to decrease cogntive load
  - citing the data source for reproducibility and to increase trustworthiness in the data visualiztions
  



      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story

# Data Visualization

## Assignment 4: Final Project

### Link to data set: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/members-of-toronto-city-council-meeting-attendance/
 
- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?

    google sheets

    > Who is your intended audience? 
    
    The intended audience  includes:

    -Toronto City Council members or officials.
    -Residents of Toronto interested in governance transparency.
    -Researchers, students, or media organizations analyzing public policy and civic engagement.

    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    
    The visualization aims to communicate patterns in council meeting attendance across different session types (Morning, Afternoon, Evening). It highlights:

    -Attendance trends over time.
    -Whether session timing impacts member participation.
    -Potential gaps or inefficiencies in meeting scheduling.

    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots? 

    Substantive Principles:

    Focus on meaningful data:
    The dataset focuses specifically on council attendance rates across session types, which directly relates to the goal of analyzing meeting participation. Irrelevant data (e.g., unrelated council activities) was excluded to maintain clarity and relevance.

    Highlighting key trends:
    The design ensures the audience can quickly identify patterns, such as whether certain sessions (e.g., evening meetings) experience lower attendance.


    Perceptual Principles:


    Use of distinct colors:
    Distinct, non-overlapping colors were applied to each attendance outome (present-Yes or present-No) (e.g., blue for morning, orange for afternoon, green for evening). This avoids confusion and allows the audience to quickly differentiate between outcomes.

    Appropriate graph type:
    Bar plot was selected because they are ideal for showing attendance trends over time or comparing categories. This graph type aligns with human perceptual strengths, making it easier to compare heights or slopes rather than interpreting more complex visual forms (e.g., pie charts).

    Logical scale and order:
    Axes were properly labeled, with intuitive scales (e.g., attendance percentages on the y-axis) that align with audience expectations.


    Aesthetic Principles:

    Clean layout with consistent fonts and labels:
    The design maintains simplicity by avoiding clutter. Labels are concise but informative, and a consistent font style is used to enhance visual harmony. Text sizes are chosen to ensure legibility.

    Spacing and alignment:
    Adequate spacing between bars or lines prevents overlap, ensuring each element is distinct and easy to read.

    Visual hierarchy:
    Key information, such as session types, is emphasized (through different text treatment), while less important elements (like gridlines or background) are muted to maintain focus on the data.

    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 

    - included link to google data sheets on graph
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    
    -Added descriptive labels for all variables, legends, and alt text for screen readers.
    -Chose high-contrast color schemes for color-blind users.
    -Kept the design simple and intuitive, avoiding overly technical jargon.

    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization? 

    -Directly impacted: Toronto City Council members and staff, who may use the insights to improve scheduling or attendance.
    -Indirectly impacted: Toronto residents, as council attendance could reflect the efficiency of decision-making in their city governance. 
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    
    -Included key variables (attendance, session types, dates) relevant to the message.
    -Excluded unrelated data (e.g., names of council members) to keep the visualization focused and privacy-compliant.

    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?

    -Data aggregation: Grouping data by session types and calculating attendance rates.
    -Design refinements: Iterating on color schemes, labels, and layouts to make the visualization clear and effective.
    

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words**

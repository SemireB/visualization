# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
        Visualization 1 - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/putra.gema.nusa7221/viz/complaint_customer/Dashboard1

        Accessible - the contrast between some of the colour used for visulas and text is not high enough, and paired with missing/unclear labels for some visuals it makes the dashboard inaccessible for data interpretation.


        Reproducible - this visualiztion doesn't explicity list the data source or methodology but it does have a download option for the specific sheets used for the dashboard or workbook so presumably some reproducibility could be possible from these downloads.

        Equitable - the presentation of the data may be biased towards feeling strong/ neative feelings given the dark red colour theme of the dashboard and the already negative language/nature of the data.Given this bias the visualization may be deemed unequitable.


        Visualization 2 - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/prasann.prem/viz/SalesAnalysisDashboard_16971728056280/SalesDashboard-Overview

        Accessible - this dashboard is accessible because the contrast between colours used for visualizations and text is high and in addition to that everything has a clear label so you don't have to rely on colour alone to interpret the data.


        Reproducible - this dashboard isn't reproducible becasue it doesn't site any of the source data or methodology used to create the dashboard.

        Equitable - this visualization could be considered equitable because of the neutral manner in which the data is displayed- the colours and language used don't evoke any strong emotions or ideals.

        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
         Visualization 1 - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/putra.gema.nusa7221/viz/complaint_customer/Dashboard1

        Accessible -  1) Use high-contrast colors to improve visibility, for visuals and overall dashboard
                      2) Provide clear labels and legends for every chart or graphic
                      3) Add alt text or descriptions for key visuals to support screen readers
                    

        Reproducible - 1) Explicitly list the data source and methodology used for creating the visualization
                     

        Equitable - 1) Reconsider the use of dark red or overly negative colors; use a neutral palette
                     to minimize emotional bias
                     2) Provide a balanced narrative that avoids framing the data solely in a negative light


        Visualization 2 - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/prasann.prem/viz/SalesAnalysisDashboard_16971728056280/SalesDashboard-Overview

        Accessible - 1) Adding alternative text for screen readers
                     2) Ensuring all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable


        Reproducible - 1) Clearly cite the data sources and provide links or references
                       2) Describe the methodology used for data processing and visualization, either in a dedicated section or tooltip

        Equitable - 1)  Explicitly checking for inclusive language
                    2) Offering explanatory notes to ensure unbiased interpretation by diverse audiences

        ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
